Matthew Slayton is a PhD Student in the Psychology and Neuroscience program at Duke University. He studies neural representation of concepts, memory, and Alzheimer's Disease. His current project involves using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) to ‘boost’ memory in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and then measuring the changes in brain network activity using fMRI.  He earned his BA in Neurolinguistics at Duke, an MA in Philosophy of Biology at the University of Chicago, and an MM in Music Composition at San Francisco Conservatory of Music.
